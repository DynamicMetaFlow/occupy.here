<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>occupy.here</strong>, please occupy this virtual space as you wish. Occupy.here is free, anonymous, and uncensored. There's nothing illegal about open local networks, the 'pirate wifi' label is just a way of explaining the idea quickly.</p>
<h2>You are not connected to the Internet</h2>
<p>This website is hosted <strong>on the wifi router</strong> you're connected to. This is the only website you can access from here. Only people who are physically nearby can access this site.</p>
<h2>What all is here?</h2>
<p>You can watch Occupy-related videos in the <a href="?x=archive">video archive</a> and you can discuss with other users in the <a href="?x=forum">message forum</a>. These are just a starting point, the project is meant to support a variety of services. We'd love to hear <a href="?x=forum">your own ideas!</a></p>
<h2>Who can access occupy.here?</h2>
<p>Anyone within range of the wifi network can connect. There is no password or verification process. <em>Messages you post in the forum will persist</em> and may be copied to other occupy.here wifi routers. Please use your own judgement about what is suitable to post on here.</p>
<h2>Who works on occupy.here?</h2>

<h2>Can I have one of my own?</h2>
<p>Yes! Occupy.here is designed to be easily replicated. Contact Dan at (314) 467-8479 if you'd like to run your own pirate wifi router. You can either invest in your own hardware (less than $100) or borrow a router if you want to try it out first.</p>
