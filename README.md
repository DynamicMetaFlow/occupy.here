## Peer-to-peer social software for the Occupy movement

[Occupy.here](http://occupyhere.org/) is a software project built in support of the [Occupy Wall Street](http://nycga.net/) protest in New York City and other occupations beyond Zuccotti Park. The project was formerly called ows.offline, referring to its capacity to run on locally-hosted hardware without an upstream Internet connection. With occupy.here, users can anonymously post messages and files to a host router running [OpenWrt Linux](https://openwrt.org/). A syncing mechanism allows remote instances of the software to exchange content using a kind of cross-pollination enabled by the movement of users.

The project is still in an early phase of development and welcomes new contributers.
