  <h2 class="top">About</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is a free, anonymous, and uncensored resource for you and your neighbors. You can post messages, share media files, and occupy the virtual space here as you wish.</p>
  <h2>You are not connected to the internet</h2>
  <p>You are connected to a wifi router running OpenWRT Linux and the server-side software needed for the website you see now. This one website is the only thing you can access from here. You are “offline” in relation to the rest of the Internet, but “online” in a way that connects you to other people within range of the wifi signal.</p>
  <h2>Occupy.here is a sparse network</h2>
  <p>While this local intranet is not connected directly to any other network, there is a way for content to find its way to other locations running occupy.here routers. As you've been browsing this site, the local database contents have been quietly backed up onto your browser. Upon connecting to another occupy.here location, the data you've carried with you is synced and merged into that router's database. Content propagates across the network using a process that resembles insects polinating flowers, but the process is slow compared to the Internet.</p>
  <h2>Named, anonymous accounts</h2>
  <p>On occupy.here you post anonymously like with weblog comments. You have a named account, but there is no password or verification process. Content you post <em>will persist</em> and may be copied to other occupy.here wifi routers.</p>
  <h2>Help us build occupy.here</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is all-volunteer, <a href="https://github.com/dphiffer/occupy.here" class="off-site">open source</a>, and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" class="off-site">Free Software</a>. <a href="http://phiffer.org/" class="off-site">Dan Phiffer</a> is the founder and lead developer, with contributions from <a href="http://boxysean.com/" class="off-site">Sean McIntyre</a> and GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/Phaeilo" class="off-site">Phaeilo</a>. In 2012 the project was fortunate to receive  a commissions grant from <a href="http://rhizome.org/" class="off-site">Rhizome</a>.</p>
  <h2>Setting up your own router</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is designed to be replicated. You can install the custom OpenWRT image on your own router. Visit <a href="http://occupyhere.org" class="off-site">occupyhere.org</a> for the step-by-step installation guide.</p>
