  <p>Occupy.here is a <em>free, anonymous, and uncensored</em> resource for you and your neighbors. You can post messages here, share media files, and occupy the virtual space as you wish.</p>
  <h2>How do I create an account?</h2>
  <p>On occupy.here you post anonymously like with weblog comments, there is no password or verification process. Messages you post <em>will persist</em> and may be copied to other occupy.here wifi routers.</p>
  <h2>Who works on occupy.here?</h2>

  <h2>Can I have one of my own?</h2>
  <p>Yes! Occupy.here is designed to be replicated. You can either invest in your own hardware (the recommended <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">Netgear N600 WNDR3700v2</a> costs around $100) or borrow a router if you'd like to try it out first. Contact Dan at (314) 467-8479 to get started.</p>
