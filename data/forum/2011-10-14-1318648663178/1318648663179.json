{"latlng":"40.709328,-74.011245","author":"dphiffer","location":"nyc","content":"This software is being developed to support the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City. It\'s a bulletin board designed to run on an autonomous wireless router (i.e., not connected to the Internet). The idea is simple: provide a forum where ideas can get hashed out beyond what\'s feasible through the General Assembly process, and engage with a broader range of people who aren\'t able to spend time at Zuccotti Park. Accessing the board on locally hosted hardware means there are fewer distractions from trolls and hecklers, and it eliminates the need for Internet connectivity (which has been hard to maintain at the park). The project is a work in progress, so please leave your feedback as a reply here and it will be taken into consideration as I continue to develop the software.","id":"1318648663179","topic_id":"1318648663178"}
