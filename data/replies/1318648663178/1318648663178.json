It\'s a bulletin board designed to run on an autonomous Linksys WRT54GL router running OpenWRT. The idea is simple: provide an online tool where ideas can get hashed out beyond what\'s feasible through the General Assembly process. Accessing the board offline means there are fewer distractions from trolls and hecklers, and it eliminates the need for Internet connectivity. It\'s a work in progress, so please check the GitHub repository (dphiffer/openwrt-forum) for updates.","author":"dphiffer","location":"nyc","latlng":"40.709328,-74.011245"}
